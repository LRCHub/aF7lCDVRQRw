[00:13.61] I'm not in the mood 'cause my flight delayed
[00:15.90] So I jumped on a private jet and I'm askin' the pilot the ETA
[00:19.26] Lambo' parked on the landin' strip, everyone in my gang and my DJ paid
[00:22.78] Why's my man talkin' 'bout Insha'Allah? These times, he don't even pray
[00:58.28]

[00:58.67] Quarter mil' for the Maybach truck, double R with the factory rims
[01:02.02] I got the 90, the Urus, the Virgil, the Brabus, I'm really a threat
